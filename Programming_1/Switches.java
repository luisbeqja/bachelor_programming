Write a program to simulate three switches. Ask for the state of each switch by reading a literal of type boolean.

Next, perform the following checks in sequence:

Check if at least two switches are turned on (on = true)
Check if exactly two switches are turned on
Check if at most one switch is turned on
*
*
*
*
Enter the state of switch 1 (true or false): false
Enter the state of switch 2 (true or false): false
Enter the state of switch 3 (true or false): false
At most one switch is turned on.
